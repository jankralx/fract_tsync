The time fractional synchronisation based on spectra phase difference
between signals for digital predistortion systems.

The scripts provided supplements a research paper Analytical Method of
Fractional Sample Period Synchronisation for Digital Predistortion
Systems by Jan KRAL, Tomas GOTTHANS, and Michal HARVANEK.

sig_sync/fract_sync_fft.m - function which detects time delay between
  two signals and compensates this delay

sig_sync/sig_delay_fft.m  - function which shifts a signal in spectrum
  domain by given delay

o1_delay_influence.m - scritp which generates figures of the
  research paper indicating the influence of time delay on digital
  predistortion systems

o2_plot_results.m - script which implements fract_sync_fft and
  sig_delay_fft functions on measured data of the digital
  predistortion system
